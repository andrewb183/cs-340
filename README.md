Before I set out on making my. Crude Python module for project one I thought about. How this function was going to be used? And how it might be used in the future? How I made it? Flexibel an reusable the most. Out of all the code that I did in this class. The. Crude function is the most crucial piece to the whole project that may be done in Jupiter books or any other format. The crude function acts. As they read, write,  update and delete Function. Is a computer science. Person were to approach the project. And a little bit different matter and focused more on graphs and charts to track how many incoming insert and months versus how many are outgoing in certain months. Versus what we did. Was just taking in the data. And had it modified an update on a dashboard. This could be. Easily rearranged to output a graph on a dashboard. Or even add it in for behind the scenes function for some other user to see. That's maybe higher up in the food chain. The client Grazioso Salvare Gave us a very basic outline of what they wanted. And there are many different ways to approach this project. And to meet. And update the database. In the future. To more suit the clients needs. An request the code itself leaves a lot of flexibility with. Very few modifications having to be made in the future.
